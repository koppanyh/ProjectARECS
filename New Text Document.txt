weekly goal was met, got a good layout for the clock in page, worked on the hardware, and talked to manager (he was impressed)

new goal: get a prototype of the hardware working and make it work with the api on the server

weekly goal was mostly met, I got a pretty nice prototype ready (almost 100% complete) and it can communicate with the server, does not actually do anything with data and clocking page not working with real data

new goal: finish the firmware, start designing the case, work on the interface
