# ProjectARECS
This project is an RFID employee time tracking system.

The acronym ARECS stands for Automatic RFID Employee Clocking System.

This project is both a software and hardware project, the software is for recording and interfacing with data generated by employees, and the hardware part is the RFID nodes that generate events based on the employees.

This was initially done as a senior project during my junior year at the University of La Verne.

The version of this project submitted for the senior project can be found archived in the senior project folder. The files outside of that are the actual project files that are in active development.
