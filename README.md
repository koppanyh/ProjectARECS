# ProjectARECS
Software and hardware files for my senior project.

This project is an RFID employee time tracking system.

The acronym ARECS stands for Automatic RFID Employee Clocking System.

This project is both a software and hardware project, the software is for recording and interfacing with data generated by employees, and the hardware part is the RFID nodes that generate events based on the employees.
